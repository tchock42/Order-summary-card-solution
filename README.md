## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is a very simple site where I can use flexbox and states. I think this kind of sites are good to reinforce my basic css and html skills.
The following code was useful to change interline height


```css
.paragraph{
    font-weight: 500;
    color: var(--desaturatedBlue);
    padding: 0 3rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.7;
}
```




### Continued development

I will start to making more challenging sites from frontedmentor.

### Useful resources

- [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/es/) - This site always help me to select color that the style guide does not have.
- [CSSMATIC](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This is useful to create box shadow.
